## ※ Notes

Leave out stuff like,

- Robo-Sports: So many papers, especially RoboCup, not sure which are important.
- Coaching/Physiology/Medicine: Fast twitch, ATP, periodization, creatine etc. New methods + lots of data might provide insight but it's too broad.
- Pose estimation/Object Detection: Too general. There are awesome lists specifically for those areas already.
- Low impact research: I can't include everything!
